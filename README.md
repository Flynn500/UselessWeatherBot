# UselessWeatherBot
 An extemley basic implementation of an ETL pipeline I mad to practice python. The script calls an API and to get weather data, convers all the temperature readings to kelvin, and then generates a report as a pdf while storing the data in a csv. The report has comments auto generated by GPT2 and which are nearly always completley incorrect and useless.
